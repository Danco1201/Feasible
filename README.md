# Feasible - The Pure-Logical Programming Language
Feasible is a programming language purely oriented toward propositional logic.

This language is designed to simplify binary and logical operations, with a syntax suitable for both beginners and experts.

## Examples
Strings may not be printable, so there is no "Hello, World!", but here is a simple program written in Feasible:
```feasible
A := true
B := false
C := A IMPLIES B 
D := C NXOR A
FACT X := A OR D
PRINT D
PRINT X
```
To get started, please read documentation (there is not documentation for now)
here will be link to docs

## Development

Solidity is still under development. Contributions are always welcome!
